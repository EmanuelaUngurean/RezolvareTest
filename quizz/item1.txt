What is regression? What is retesting?

For regression:  1. We test an application and we find a bug;
                 2. We send that bug to the developers;
                 3. The developers fix the bug;
                 4. We have to test all the features that we suppose the fixed bug has impact.

For retesting: 1. We test an application and we find a bug;
               2. We send that bug to the developers;
               3. The developers fix the bug;
               4. We have to test just the behavior of that fixed bug.
